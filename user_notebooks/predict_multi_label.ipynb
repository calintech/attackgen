They do not have destructive behaviour in the first place, so their presence on a victim’s system might not be detected for quite an amount of time if the victim has no proper antivirus product installed. Since Panda is possibly among the most dangerous familiesofbankingtrojans, wedecidedtodoacomprehensiveanalysisofarecentsample of Panda. In this paper we focus on the analysis of the binary part of a Zeus.Panda malware sample. Foradetailedanalysisoftheactualwebinjectbehaviourandthecommunication flow between infected machines and the automatic transfer system’s server, please refer 1 2 to our blogposts by Manuel Körber-Bilgard and Karsten Tellmann. 1 https://cyber.wtf/2017/02/03/zeus-panda-webinjects-a-case-study/ 2 https://cyber.wtf/2017/03/13/zeus-panda-webinjects-dont-trust-your-eyes/ 2 Overview 2.1 General Information The original Zeus banking trojan’s source code was leaked in 2011 and since then several independent threat actors have used the source code as a basis for new variants of the malware. One of the most prolific and advanced of these variants is the Zeus.Panda banking trojan which we will analyse in this white paper. Zeus.Panda targets Windows operating systems from WinXP through Windows 10 and is typically spread through phishing mail campaigns, but proliferation through drive-by exploits has been seen.

If either of those matches the current keyboard layout, Panda removes itself from the victim’s PC. 3.1.3 Anti analysis check The last step of the pre-run checks is a rather long list of checks for debug and analysis tools. Some of these tools are antiquated such as SoftIce where support stopped long before Windows XP which is the least recent operating system supported by Panda. Other of the tools such as IDA Pro and Immunity Debugger remain popular tools with 3.1 Malware Startup Checks 7 malware analysts. If any of these tools are present Panda aborts execution and removes itself.

With (one of) the CSP header(s) sent by the web server, a website owner can tell the browser in detail, from where to load e.g. additional JavaScript code. Correctly configured, this hinders Panda to retrieve the second stage loader because it is loaded from a different web server.

ButsincePandainterceptswebtrafficbetween the raw socket and the handling of the browser, it cannot inject the malicious code into the response body because the web server never sent some.

This lowers the bounds for the malware to hook all necessary functions. Panda hooks the functions PR_Close, PR_Read, PR_Write, and PR_Poll by overwriting some bytes in the function prologue like it does for all Windows API hooks (see section 5.4). Similarly to Internet Explorer, Panda modifies the user preferences the better fit the needs of the malware. In the case of Firefox, it walks through the profiles directory of Firefox’s settings directory (%APPDATA%\\Mozilla\\Firefox) and sets the following user preferences to false: ∙ privacy.clearOnShutdown.cookies ∙ security.warn_viewing_mixed ∙ security.warn_viewing_mixed.show_once ∙ security.warn_submit_insecure ∙ security.warn_submit_insecure.show_once ∙ security.warn_entering_secure ∙ security.warn_entering_weak ∙ security.warn_leaving_secure ∙ network.http.spdy.enabled ∙ network.http.spdy.enabled.v2 ∙ network.http.spdy.enabled.v3 5.5.3 Google Chrome Hooking Google’s Chrome browser is different compared to Firefox or Internet Explorer, because Chrome uses functions from both the</td>\n",

Additionally, Panda hooks GetClipboardData. Hooking this specific function allows the malware authors to capture passwords that are not typed by the user but instead are pasted into the form fields in the browser (e.g. because the passwords are saved in a file on disk or because the user uses a password manager). 5.6 Plug-in ability The Panda malware has the ability to dynamically load malware modules from web resources and to execute them in-place. This makes Panda a very flexible malware that can be retrofitted for other purposes. Technically, they re-implemented LoadLibrary without the need of having the actual library on disk. First, the malware allocates enough space for the loaded DLL in the virtual memory of its process using VirtualAlloc. Afterwards, Panda section-wise copiestheDLLintothepreviouslyallocatedblockofmemory. BecauseDLLsareposition independent, the third step is to relocate the sections. To achieve that, Panda walks through the relocation table (.reloc section) and resolves the required relocations by applying the</td>\n",

They do not have destructive behaviour in the first place, so their presence on a victim’s system might not be detected for quite an amount of time if the victim has no proper antivirus product installed. Since Panda is possibly among the most dangerous familiesofbankingtrojans, wedecidedtodoacomprehensiveanalysisofarecentsample of Panda. In this paper we focus on the analysis of the binary part of a Zeus.Panda malware sample.

One of the most prolific and advanced of these variants is the Zeus.Panda banking trojan which we will analyse in this white paper. Zeus.Panda targets Windows operating systems from WinXP through Windows 10 and is typically spread through phishing mail campaigns, but proliferation through drive-by exploits has been seen. The sample analyzed in this whitepaper is: MD5 Packed: e005c4009c22e0f73fcdaeba99bd0075 Unpacked: 655f65b1b08621dfcb2603b59fca05bc SHA1 Packed: 6f5c186baa0d69799c250769052236b8bcfb13a1 Unpacked: 88782d3b74067d405e56f0a5e9b92e3fdb77dcd8 SHA256 Packed: d037723b90acb9d5a283d54b833e171e913f6fa7f44dd6d996d0cecae9595d0b Unpacked: bd956b2e81731874995b9b92e20f75dbf67ac5f12f9daa194525e1b673c7f83c Size   \n",

In the sample I analyzed, the list contained 0x419, 0x422, 0x423, 0x43f which stand for russian, ukrainian, belarusian, and kazakh, respec- tively. If either of those matches the current keyboard layout, Panda removes itself from the victim’s PC. 3.1.3 Anti analysis check The last step of the pre-run checks is a rather long list of checks for debug and analysis tools. Some of these tools are antiquated such as SoftIce where support stopped long before Windows XP which is the least recent operating system supported by Panda. Other of the tools such as IDA Pro and Immunity Debugger remain popular tools with 3.1 Malware Startup Checks 7 malware analysts. If any of these tools are present Panda aborts execution and removes itself. To identify analysis tools Panda uses four different types of tests: file use CreateFile with OPEN_EXISTING flag to check if a file/device exists mutex use OpenMutex to try to open an existing mutex running process useCreateToolhelp32Snapshottogetthelistofcurrentlyrunningprocesssesand check if any of them contains   \n",

This configuration is created by the command-and-control server on demand and can change at any time. This allows the malware operator to maintain his control capabillity even in the event that the static configured command and control server is shut down. But especially the dynamic configuration is interesting for malware analysts because it contains the URLs and/or IP addresses of the ATS server(s).

The name of the file is of the form updXXXXXXXX.exe where XXXXXXXX is the hexadecimal representation of a 4-byte random number. After writing the file and applying the PeSettings to the Extended File Attributes, the ”update” is executed using CreateProcessW with -f as an argument flag. This triggers the ”update” functionality of the bot so that all necessary settings are copied over to the new executable.

First, it tries to get a dynamic configuration file from the URL provided in url_config in the old dynamic config. Of course, this only works if Panda already received a dynamic config once. If it did not receive a dynamic config at that point, it tries to get a configuration file from each of the command-and-control domains of the base config. In case Panda is not able to download the dynamic config using the URL from the url_config field and the fallback command-and-control hosts (the malware allows for 5 failed retries for each of the domains), Panda takes   \n",

But the suffix can change and is not bound to any special requirements except for that it needs to make a valid domain from the generated name. 5 Payload and Persistence 5.1 Persistence As part of the initialization procedure, Panda tries to persist in the following manner: First, it finds a suitable folder for the malware executable to reside in. In our case, it chose %APPDATA%\\Sun\\Java. It then moved the malware executable from the desktop to that folder and renamed it to Desktop (Create Shortcut).exe. Panda also creates threeextrafileswithrandomfileextensionswhichwillbelaterusedtotemporarilystore data. After moving the malware executable to the new folder, Panda adds a new value   \n",

But there is a problem: today’s web browser implement a feature called content- security policy. With (one of) the CSP header(s) sent by the web server, a website owner can tell the browser in detail, from where to load e.g. additional JavaScript code. Correctly configured, this hinders Panda to retrieve the second stage loader because it is loaded from a different web server. But since Panda is a man-in-the-browser malware, it can remove those headers from the server response and the browser will retrieve the loader.

If Panda would not remove the If-Modified-Since header, a web server might send a response with a 304 status code and no response body content. Usually, this instructs the browser to use a cached version of the web page because the pagecontentdidnotchangesincethelastrequest(thetimeofthelastrequestisspecified intheIf-Modified-Sinceheaderfield). ButsincePandainterceptswebtrafficbetween the raw socket and the handling of the browser, it cannot inject the malicious code into the response body because the web server never sent some. So, Panda must ensure that the web server sends a response body to be able to execute its injects. This can be achieved by removing the If-Modified-Since header and thereby simulating a fresh request to the web server. Another thing Panda needs to take care of is Accept-Encodings.

Valid content types are: ∙ text/ ∙ application/x-javascript ∙ application/javascript ∙ application/xml ∙ application/xhtml+xml ∙ application/octet-stream ∙ application/json Panda does not only inject data into web pages, it already grabs data at that point. If Panda finds any Authentication headers in the request, it checks for basic authentication and extracts username and password from it and adds it to the report. Additionally, Panda can extract all request data from GET and POST requests and reports them to the command-and-control server.

This lowers the bounds for the malware to hook all necessary functions. Panda hooks the functions PR_Close, PR_Read, PR_Write, and PR_Poll by overwriting some bytes in the function prologue like it does for all Windows API hooks (see section 5.4).

In the case of Firefox, it walks through the profiles directory of Firefox’s settings directory (%APPDATA%\\Mozilla\\Firefox) and sets the following user preferences to false: ∙ privacy.clearOnShutdown.cookies ∙ security.warn_viewing_mixed ∙ security.warn_viewing_mixed.show_once ∙ security.warn_submit_insecure ∙ security.warn_submit_insecure.show_once ∙ security.warn_entering_secure ∙ security.warn_entering_weak ∙ security.warn_leaving_secure ∙ network.http.spdy.enabled ∙ network.http.spdy.enabled.v2 ∙ network.http.spdy.enabled.v3 5.5.3 Google Chrome Hooking Google’s Chrome browser is different compared to Firefox or Internet Explorer, because Chrome uses functions from both the   \n",

The difference between hooking Firefox and Chrome is that Chrome has a statically linked nspr4.dll instead of a dynamically linked one like Firefox has. Unfortunately, this has the conse- quencethatoneisnotabletouseGetProcAddresstogettheaddressofthefunctionand tooverwritesomebytesatthataddress. However,Chromeinternallyusesaglobalstruct of function pointers pointing to the actual functions. A pointer to this struct is shipped with each connection that is made by the browser. Panda tries to find the global struct and overwrites the function pointers in that specific struct to hook Chrome’s NSPR4 functions. The list of hooked functions (including Window API function) is as follows: ∙ PR_Write (NSPR4 overwrite) 5.6 Plug-in ability 26 ∙ PR_Read (NSPR4 overwrite) ∙ PR_Close (NSPR4 overwrite) ∙ closesocket (WinAPI-Hook) ∙ WSARecv (WinAPI-Hook) ∙ WSASend (WinAPI-Hook) ∙ recv (WinAPI-Hook) 5.5.4 User Functions In addition to the MITB hooks, Panda can   \n",

Additionally, Panda hooks GetClipboardData. Hooking this specific function allows the malware authors to capture passwords that are not typed by the user but instead are pasted into the form fields in the browser (e.g. because the passwords are saved in a file on disk or because the user uses a password manager). 5.6 Plug-in ability The Panda malware has the ability to dynamically load malware modules from web resources and to execute them in-place. This makes Panda a very flexible malware that can be retrofitted for other purposes. Technically, they re-implemented LoadLibrary without the need of having the actual library on disk. First, the malware allocates enough space for the loaded DLL in the virtual memory of its process using VirtualAlloc. Afterwards, Panda section-wise copiestheDLLintothepreviouslyallocatedblockofmemory. BecauseDLLsareposition independent, the third step is to relocate the sections. To achieve that, Panda walks through the relocation table (.reloc section) and resolves the required relocations by applying the   \n",

The main purpose of Panda is to serve as a bankning trojan. Therefore its author equipped the malware with sophisticated capabilities and supports all major browsers in the Windows ecosystem. However, Panda shows significant flexibility allowing it to be used for other malicous purposes. For example, Panda implements a modifiable configuration that can be changed at any time by the attacker.
